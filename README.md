# functionalCore

My attempt to understand https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/functional-core-imperative-shell 

## thoughts 

- Imperative shell consumes functional core
- Unit testing between functional core lib (business logic) and imperative shell (main) part  
- Integration / e2e testing the imperative shell part (maybe?)
